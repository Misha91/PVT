# PVT


<br/>
<b>The Task</b><br/>
The project is a try to make a trajectory map based on steering done and odometry for F1Tenth competition as PVT (Team Work) project. When the map loops, algorithms predicts safe area to speed up based on confidence and expected steering angle ahead - green is significant speed up, yellow is medium. The speed up status is published into ROS topic.
